# Who are we?

Weâ€™re a UK-based non-profit organization that focuses on developing innovative and low-cost technologies to protect endangered species and their habitats.
Arribada was founded in 2017 by a team of conservationists and engineers, and it takes its name from the Spanish word "arribada," which means "arrival" and refers to the mass nesting of sea turtles.
